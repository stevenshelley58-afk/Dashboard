# Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Folder Structure Created

The following structure is ready for your specs:

```
Dashboard/
├── agents/          ✅ Ready
├── config/          ✅ Ready
├── memory/          ✅ Ready
├── utils/           ✅ Ready
├── specs/           ✅ Upload your files here
├── uploads/         ✅ Alternative upload location
├── logs/            ✅ Logs will appear here
├── .checkpoints/    ✅ Checkpoints will be stored here
└── tests/           ✅ Tests will be stored here
```

## 📤 What to Upload

### Option 1: Single Comprehensive Spec
Create one file with everything (e.g., `specs/my_project.md`)

### Option 2: Multiple Files
Break it down into multiple files:
- `specs/tech_stack.md`
- `specs/features.md`
- `specs/architecture.md`
- etc.

### Option 3: Existing Code + Spec
Upload your existing code files + a brief spec

## 📋 Complete Checklist (from SPEC_REQUIREMENTS.md)

### Must Have:
- ✅ Project type (web app, API, CLI, etc.)
- ✅ Technology stack (languages, frameworks)
- ✅ Core features/requirements

### Nice to Have:
- ✅ Architecture preferences
- ✅ UI/UX requirements
- ✅ Deployment target
- ✅ Testing requirements
- ✅ Existing code/files

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Upload your spec files to `specs/` folder**
2. **Tell me when you're done** - I'll analyze everything
3. **I'll build the agent system** tailored to your needs

## 📝 Tips

- **Be specific**: More details = better results
- **Include examples**: Sample data, mockups, etc.
- **Upload existing code**: If you have starter code, include it
- **Don't worry about format**: I can work with any format (markdown, text, etc.)

Ready when you are! 🚀
